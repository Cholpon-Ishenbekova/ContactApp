# ContactApp
Java FX project

Contact Address Book GUI using Java FX • This project would mainly focus on creating a simple contacts application using JavaFX that has a single main window. • The application will allow the user to add a contact, edit a contact, and delete a contact. • The contacts would be displayed using the TableView control. • There will be a ContactData class, which would provide a way to load and store contacts using XML. • Moreover, in addition to the ContactData class, a contact class would be needed to store individual contacts. • For each contact, first name, last name, phone numbers, and notes would be stored. • The contact information might be stored in certain string fields. • To get data binding to work with the TableView, the contact information would be stored as SimpleStringProperty fields. • Application class would be inherited to the Main class.
